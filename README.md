# Fillit
#### This is the Fillit project @ 42 Paris.
[100/100][Subject] (https://github.com/ablin42/fillit/blob/master/fillit.pdf)

Fillit will allow you to discover and get familiar with a recurring programming situation: finding the best solution among a huge number of possibilities within an acceptable time span. For this project, you are expected to fit Tetriminos together to shape the smallest possible square.

### Note : the tetriminos '#' are replaced by a letter ranging from A to Z depending on their input order

# Here is 4 tetriminos being assembled together into the smallest square possible (4x4)
